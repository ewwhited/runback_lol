# Runback

_Track if you have ever played with your current teammates before, from the command line._

If you're like me and you play a lot of League, you sometimes recognize names of people you have played with before. Instead of having to remember names, let Runback do it for you.

This project was mostly about messing around with learning Python and sqlite3 basics. I don't plan to do too much more with it, beyond a few clean-ups. 

Runback uses the Riot API to store what Summoners you have played with before in a local sqlite db.
